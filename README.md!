# SOS 598 Research Data Management assignment submission workflow

## Overview

Version control is a critical component of reproducible research. In this class, we will demonstrate the use of Git as an effective tool for version control. GitHub is a cloud-based platform that integrates with Git, and greatly extends its functionality. There is a learning curve to these tools for sure, but they are worth your time and effort. Rather than using manufactured examples, we will provide practical experience to these tools by using them for the homework assignments in this course. We have created for each of you a private GitHub repository within the SOS598-RDM GitHub organization. Repositories are identified by lastname_firstname. Only you have write access to your repository, but all students have read access to all repositories. As such, the assignments that you submit are viewable by your classmates, which, as explained below, is a critical features needed to address your peer reviews.

The general workflow to submitting assignments and addressing peer reviews is outlined below. Detailed instructions are provided in subsequent sections of the document. The instructions detailed here employ GitKraken to manage Git, but GitHub's Desktop software, or the command-line-interface would work just as well. There are links to GitKraken and GitHub Desktop on the front page of the course website. We will use the private repository earl_stevan as an example for this document.

**overview of steps**
1. clone your GitHub repository
2. populate your repository
3. add/stage, commit
4. push files to your GitHub repository
5. open a GitHub issue when assignment is complete
6. submit peer review by opening a GitHub issue

## clone your GitHub repository

GitHub (GH) is a cloud-based service. In this sense, we can think of GH kind of like Dropbox. Much like Dropbox, we do not actually work in GitHub. Rather, we work on our local machines, then add files to our repository on GitHub as needed. To do this, we first have to clone (similar to copy) our GitHub directory onto our local machine so that we can add files that we would like to manage with version control.

To clone your repository, we need to get its address. Do this by navigating to your repository, and clicking on the green 'Clone or download' button. This will bring up a dialog box that display the address of your repository. While this dialog box is open, clicking on the small icon that resembles a clipboard will copy the address to your computer's clip board.
