# Introduction

This is the introduction to our Mayfly study.

# Methods

We collected *Atalophlebia* nymphs from study streams using kick nets.

# Results

Insect density was lowest in urban streams.

# Discussion

Artificial structures designed to reduce water velocity in urban streams may increase *Atalophlebia* fecundity.
