## SOS 519/598 Research Data Management: Data Management Plan exercise

### overview

1.  Generate a complete DMP using the [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/). Ideally, the DMP should reflect your research - think of this as an opportunity to receive feedback on your strategies for managing your research data. If you are not far enough along in your research program to be able to thoughtfully complete a DMP, work through a related but fictionalized project or develop a DMP for the project of one of your lab mates - anything even close to your research could provide helpful insight to your own work.
2.  Download your completed Data Management Plan in PDF format.
3.  Upload the PDF to a new issue that you generate in the repository created for your Airbnb assignment (i.e., airbnb-san-diego-your-github-user-name) in the course GitHub organization. The title of the issue should be: `data management plan`; be sure to `@` mention me in the issue so that I am alerted to your submission.
