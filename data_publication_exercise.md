## overview

In this exercise, you will submit a well-documented data set of your own data (or data related to your research) to [Harvard's demo dataverse (HDD)](https://demo.dataverse.org/){:target="\_blank"}. HDD is a development or scratch environment version of the University's dataverse repository - please be sure that you address this exercise in the demo environment!


## adding metadata to data files

Harvard's dataverse is very limited in the level of detail that ....




## accessing and navigating HDD

ASU has an institutional affiliation with the Harvard dataverse so you will use ASU's ASURITE system to access HDD. Once authenticated with ASURITE, you can log into HDD by identifying Arizona State University as your institution.

A dataverse (a collection of datasets) has been created within HDD for this course, and is where you will publish your data set. Please see [this](https://demo.dataverse.org/dataverse/RDM_2018){:target="\_blank"} link or search for 'SOS_RDM_2018_demoverse' within HDD to locate the dataverse for this class.


## adding your data set

Once you have logged into HDD and navigated to the SOS_RDM_2018_demoverse, you can begin the process of adding your data set by clicking the 'Add Data' button, and selecting 'New Dataset'.
